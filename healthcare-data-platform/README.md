# üè• Healthcare Data Platform on AWS

A HIPAA-aligned data platform that centralizes Electronic Health Records (EHR), claims, and care-management notes for real-time population health analytics, risk scoring, and proactive patient outreach.

---

## 1. üß© Problem & Solution

### Business Problem
Healthcare organizations struggle with:
- Data silos across EHR, claims, and care management systems.
- No unified view of high-risk patients likely to be readmitted.
- Manual spreadsheet outreach and slow reporting.
- Compliance risk when PHI is shared insecurely.

### AWS Solution
This platform:
- Centralizes PHI into secure, encrypted data zones (raw ‚Üí curated ‚Üí analytics).
- Automates ingestion of EHR, claims, and nurse outreach notes.
- Uses AWS Glue ETL to clean, join, and compute patient risk scores.
- Exposes curated, governed analytics to Athena + QuickSight.
- Triggers Lambda + SNS alerts when a high-risk patient needs outreach.

**Impact:** Care teams get daily ‚Äúcall these patients now‚Äù alerts. Leadership gets live readmission KPIs. All access is auditable and least-privilege.

## 5. üé• Demo / Walkthrough

**Step 1:** Nurse submits outreach note via API Gateway  
**Step 2:** Event lands in `s3://hcp-raw-zone/care_mgmt/` through Kinesis Firehose  
**Step 3:** Glue ETL joins EHR + claims + outreach, computes `risk_score`  
**Step 4:** Athena query:  
```sql
SELECT patient_id, risk_score, last_outreach_status
FROM curated_patient_risk
WHERE risk_score >= 80;
```
**Step 5:** QuickSight dashboard highlights ‚ÄúHigh-Risk Patients Requiring Outreach Today.‚Äù

Screenshots of these steps (with dummy data) go into `/5-analytics/quicksight_storyboard.md`.

## 6. üí∞ Cost Optimization

- Used **serverless / on-demand services** (Lambda, Glue, Athena) instead of always-on EC2.
- **Athena + S3 Parquet** instead of running a full data warehouse 24/7.
- **Lifecycle policies**: S3 automatically pushes older data to Glacier Deep Archive.
- **Smaller Glue DPUs** and on-demand schedules for dev/test.
- Infra is defined as code so dev environments can be created/teared down fast.

## 7. ‚öôÔ∏è Challenges & Lessons Learned

**Identity Resolution Across Systems**  
Different systems used different patient IDs. I built a master patient dimension in Glue to unify identity and enable cross-source analytics.

**Access Control vs. Analytics Speed**  
Analysts wanted full raw detail, but compliance enforces minimum necessary PHI access. I solved this by splitting `raw`, `curated`, and `analytics` zones and applying IAM boundaries + QuickSight row-level security.

**Alert Fatigue**  
Initial logic spammed care coordinators. I added business rules in Lambda to suppress duplicate alerts within 24 hours of a successful call.

**Cost vs. Performance**  
Chose Athena and Parquet on S3 for MVP to avoid paying for an idle data warehouse. Redshift Serverless is optional if query volume justifies it.

---

## 8. üîê Compliance Positioning

- All PHI is encrypted in transit (TLS) and at rest (SSE-KMS).
- Private VPC endpoints mean PHI data never traverses the public internet.
- Least-privilege IAM roles restrict who can access `raw` vs `analytics`.
- CloudTrail captures full access logs for auditing.
- The design uses only HIPAA-eligible AWS services and is intended to run under a BAA.
